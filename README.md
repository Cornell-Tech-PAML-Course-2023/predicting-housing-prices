# predicting-housing-prices

The goal of this notebook is to explore multiple regression and feature engineering Sklearn functions.

In this notebook you will use data on house sales in California to predict prices using multiple, polynomial, ridge, and lasson regression. You will:
* Perform feature engineering
* Remove outliers
* Handling Text and Categorical Attributes
* Train multiple regression models 
* Inspect coefficients and interpret their meanings
* Evaluate multiple models via RMSE, MAE, and R2
* Use Cross validation to regularize weights to shrink coefficients of features not useful for predicting housing prices
